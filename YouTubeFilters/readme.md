## For YouTube's new layout (2023)

YouTube channels often contain many more videos than will fit onto one screen. When you scroll down past the bottom of "the fold", YouTube will display a spinner and load the next screen-full of videos. (This is called Lazy-Loading)

Sometimes you might wish to search through all the channel's videos to find all videos with a certain keyword in the title. Before you can do that, though, you must page-down forever and forever until all the channel's videos have finally been loaded - then you can search through the entire group of them for the ones you want to see.  Of course, YouTube provides a search feature... yeah. Right. Anyway.

This Tampermonkey script adds a few discreet buttons to the top of every YouTube channel. First, you can hide all the thumbnail images, which allows you to see more than double the number of videos on a page. You can also "Scroll To Bottom" and allow this TM script to take care of loading all the videos for you - freeing your hands to hold and manipulate your coffee cup.

Note that videos that are being hidden (all changes made to this channel) are only visible to you - they are only being changed on your local computer/device.

Once all the channel's videos are all loaded and you can scroll up/down through the entire collection - you can filter out the ones you don't want to see. Suppose there are 100 videos in the channel, and 70 of those are about the Mandela Effect (and you already know all about that and you don't want those videos cluttering up the rest). Click the Remove Only button and enter Mand - and everything with "Mand" in the video title will be hidden.

Or, suppose there are a handful of videos in that channel about how to use the Shotcut video editor. Hit the Keep Only button and type "Shotcut" - and now only the 7 videos that all have the word "Shotcut" in the video title are visible.

To un-hide everything that you filtered out (via Remove Only / Keep Only), click on the Remove All Filters button. All videos will again be visible.
