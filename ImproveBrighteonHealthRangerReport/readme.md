## Brighteon NEW-VIDEOS and HEALTH RANGER REPORT

For Mike Adams' viral [Health Ranger Report](https://www.brighteon.com/channels/hrreport).

The default page layout shows around 18 video titles per page and you need to scroll a few times to see all the videos. The goal here, as always, is to see as much on the first screen as possible.  This was accomplished by moving the descriptions on top of the thumbnail images and tinkering with transparency/colors to make it look great. Now, on most larger monitors (1920x1080) you should see all the videos for that page on the screen, without any need to scroll.
