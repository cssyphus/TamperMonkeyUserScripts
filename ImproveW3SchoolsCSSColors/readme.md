## W3Schools.com CSS Colors page

https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp

The original page displays three color blocks on each line, and a maximum of 21 per page (only 12 on the first page).

This script removes some page elements (such as the right-sidebar etc) and adds the following buttons to top-left of page:

[25] [20] [15] [10] [5] [Black] [Full]

The first five buttons relate to the sizing of each color block ("5" being the smallest). When the 5 button is pressed, you can see up to 148 color blocks per screen. At [25], you see approximately 24 per screen).

If press the [Full] toggle button, the top navbar and left sidebar are hidden, increasing the size of each block.

If press the [Black] toggle button, the screen background becomes black.

With [Full] and [5] both pressed, you can see all 148 color blocks on one screen.
