## SIMPLE Vanilla JavaScript Tooltips - for inclusion in TamperMonkey scripts

So you want tooltips, but you shouldn't need to install popper/tippy, Bootstrap or jQueryUI just to get them. It should be easier than that, right?

Well it is.

Here are:

* Two javascript functions (create/remove)
* One CSS class
* Implementation instructions

Tah... DAH!

This is a much stripped-down implementation of [vanilla-js-tooltip from Zoltan Toth](https://github.com/zoltantothcom/vanilla-js-tooltip).
